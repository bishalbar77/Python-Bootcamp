Steps followed:
1. Board Design
2. Update board (User input on board)
3. Play game
4. Handle turn (switch between X and O)
5. Check if game is over - Who wins
    - check for rows
    - check for column
    - check for diagonal
6. Check for Tie
7. Flip Player
8. Back to 2

Starting point computer case => 0
